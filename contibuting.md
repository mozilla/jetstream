How we handle issues:

Issues with labels attached are ignored during triage. Please do not label new issues unless you also add them to the Triage column of the [Cirrus project board].

Issues we intend to work in the near term are added to the [Cirrus project board].

Issues we do not intend to work in the near term are labeled and not added to the project board.

Time-definite milestones are represented as columns on the [Cirrus project board]. Milestones are complete when all cards in the column are complete. Completed issues remain in the milestone column.

A "backlog" column exists for issues that we intend to work in the near term but do not correspond to a time-definite milestone.
