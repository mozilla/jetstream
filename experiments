These WebExtensions were carefully curated and no performance impact was discerned for them. Show all recommendations once.  Max one per day across all add ons.  \r\n\r\nThese recommendations are shown based on passing a set threshold, then hitting a trigger (specific site visit), and obeying the unique recipe (language, not already installed, etc.)\r\n\r\nExperiment 2 (incl. notifications for for 5 add-ons: Facebook Container, Reddit Enhancement Suite, Wikipedia Context Menu Search, Enhancer for YouTube, To Google Translate).  Show recommendation three times (if hit the targeting threshold).  Max one per day across all add ons.\r\n\r\nWhen the site becomes an “organic top sites”, that is the first threshold.  The recommendation is triggered the next time that user does a specific action (in this case visiting the site).  This also depends the rest of the recipe matches (ex: the add-on or an identified similar add-on isn’t already installed).  We specify “organic top sites” because there are “default” topsites pre-populated.  The threshold only looks at “organic top sites”, which are based off user visit frecency.\r\nA site becomes an “organic top site” for a user when that site’s frecency score places in the top 25 against all other sites the user visits, and when the minimum frecency score is greater than 10,000.  The intention of these conditions is to target sites that are important to a user, but that brand new profiles (new users) do not immediately get inundated with CFR recommendations.\r\nThe Firefox frecency algorithm is defined more precisely in this MDN article\r\nFor a new profile, pasting a URL into the address bar five times will be enough to put it in the top 25 sites and will set the frecency score high enough to cause targeting.  Older profiles are more difficult because frecency scores can grow unbounded.  For a detailed discussion about testing CFR and querying a profile’s frecenct sites, refer to the CFR Planning Document.\r\n\r\nThese additional cohorts are pending legal / data review and approval from Marshal and Kev.  Note that this approval does not block this experiment.  If we can’t get the approvals in time, let’s launch the experiment with the above three cohorts.\r\nExperiment 3 (incl. notifications for 6 add-ons: Facebook Container, Reddit Enhancement Suite, Wikipedia Context Menu Search, Enhancer for YouTube, To Google Translate, Amazon Assistant).
